  "case": "29F, PCOS (Rotterdam+), cycles q45-90d. BMI 32, fasting insulin 18 mIU/L, mild hirsutism. TTC 12 months. Partner SA normal.\n\nQ: Step-wise ovulation induction approach, lifestyle/meds, IVF escalation timing?",
  "full_response": "The final decision is: no. This patient has persistent symptoms of hyperandrogenism despite medical therapy for her polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and has not achieved pregnancy within a reasonable amount of time. Given the presence of elevated insulin levels in addition to a diagnosis of PCOS, I recommend that she pursue an aggressive weight loss program. She should aim to lose approximately half of her excess body weight over six months to address both her hyperandrogenism and her infertility due to PCOS. If after losing this amount of weight she still does not achieve menstrual regularity or become pregnant, then additional ovulatory stimulation with clomiphene citrate can be pursued. Alternatively, if the patient were to lose only about one-quarter to one-third of her excess weight, then injectable gonadotropins could be recommended as first-line therapy.\n</thinking></s>oh/ref>ah/t>\n",
