  "case": "38F, regular cycles. Day 3 FSH 15.2 mIU/mL, AMH 0.4 ng/mL, AFC 4. TTC 18 months. BMI 22. Partner SA normal.\n\nQ: IVF prognosis, treatment protocol, and alternatives?",
  "full_response": "IVF success rates for women aged 37 or older with a high AMH level (0.5–8 ng/mL) typically range from 30% to 40%, assuming there is no male factor infertility involved. The prognosis generally depends on several factors, including ovarian reserve as assessed by AFC (Antral Follicle Count), overall quality of eggs, sperm quality if the male partner is involved, age, and the ability to control stress effectively during the process. If you have concerns about your age or hormonal balance, it might be worth considering methods like egg freezing or investigating additional options such as ICSI, which can help improve pregnancy chances in less optimal scenarios.\n</thinking></s> ",
