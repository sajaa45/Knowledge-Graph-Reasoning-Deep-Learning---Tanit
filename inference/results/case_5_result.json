  "case": "36F, 3 consecutive 1st trimester losses at 6-8w with prior fetal cardiac activity. No living children. Parental karyotypes normal. Thyroid normal, non-diabetic.\n\nQ: Differential diagnosis, workup, and treatments to improve success?",
  "full_response": "The patient has experienced three first-trimester miscarriages within the past few months without a viable pregnancy, and is hoping to conceive again in the future. Given her age of 36 years old and the fact that she has no surviving children, it seems reasonable to evaluate her ovarian reserve status using tests like AMH, AFC, and an HSG. These assessments will help determine if there are any underlying issues related to egg quality or quantity affecting her chances of conceiving successfully. Addressing potential hormonal imbalances through medication could potentially boost her ovarian function over time, which might enhance her prospects of becoming pregnant in the future.\n</thinking></s> ",
